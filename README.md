# mean & gaussian filter
&nbsp; Here we have used two libraries, **mahotas and OpenCv**, for mean filter and apply different mean filters for them and also compare two times 3 * 3 filter with 9 * 9 filter to see if they have a same result.
In the second part, we have applied different gaussian filters on image and compare. And at the end, we compared gaussian filter and mean filter of the image (using OpenCV library) to see whether they had the same result or not.
